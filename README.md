# üß† Pima Indians Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a person is diabetic or not using the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**. The model is trained using **Logistic Regression**, a simple yet powerful classification algorithm.

## üìÅ Dataset

- The dataset contains **768 records** of female patients of Pima Indian heritage.
- Each record contains 8 medical predictors and 1 target variable:
  
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Pregnancies | Number of pregnancies |
| Glucose | Plasma glucose concentration |
| BloodPressure | Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) |
| SkinThickness | Triceps skin fold thickness (mm) |
| Insulin | 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) |
| BMI | Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2) |
| Diabetes
